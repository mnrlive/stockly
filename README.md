> Stockly is the go to website to follow / search stocks daily. This is a React based application that fetches a live updated Stocks API to retrieve precise data. This project consists on 2 pages. On the one hand, we have a master page where we can visualize the Most Gainers and Most Losers Lists, and also a main Stocks List which can be filtered. On the other hand, we have a Stock Detail page. Whenever you click on an item on the Stock List, you will be redirected to the Stock Detail page using React Router.

## Live Demo
**API usage is restricted to 250 requests, please be mindful when using the filter search since it
makes 2 requests to the API endpoing**
